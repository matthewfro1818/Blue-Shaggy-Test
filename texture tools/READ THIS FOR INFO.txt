These are the scripts I made for converting PNG files into FUNK files.

NOTE: You will need to install Python 3.10 and will also need to install all of these Python libraries: numpy, Pillow, lz4

A more detailed explanation of FUNK files can be found here: https://github.com/doggy-dentures/tnt/issues/1
But the gist of it is that FUNK files load faster and use less memory than PNG files.
Just drop your PNGs into one of the items folders and run the corresponding .bat file for the folder.

FUNK files can contain one of several texture formats, each with their own use cases. They all take up less memory than PNGs.

BC7 	High quality, supports transparency. 1 byte per pixel. Good for images with transparency or color gradients.
DXT1 	Medium quality. 0.5 bytes per pixel. Good for rectangular backgrounds that don't need transparency.
DXT5	Medium quality. 1 byte per pixel. Outclassed by BC7 but most GPUs from 2011 and older don't support BC7. Good for images with transparency on older hardware that doesn't support BC7.
RGB5A1	Original quality, but with less color precision and each pixel is either invisible or fully opaque. 2 bytes per pixel. Good for pixel art when pixels only have transparency values of 0% or 100%.
RGBA4	Original quality, even less color precision than RGB5A1 but fully supports transparency. 2 bytes per pixel. Good for pixel art that uses a wide range of transparency values.

For reference, PNGs use 4 bytes per pixel in memory. So using FUNK files for sprites uses 8x less memory at best and 2x less memory at worst.
